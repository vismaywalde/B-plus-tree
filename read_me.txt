Project Name:Implementation and Analysis of B+ trees

Summary: Our project entails the implementation and analysis of B+ Trees.
The project explored the fundamental concepts, design, and performance analysis
of B+ trees, a popular data structure in computer science and database manage-
ment. B+ trees are widely used to optimize database indexing and enhance search
and retrieval operations. The primary focus of the project was on the implemen-
tation of B+ trees. The team implemented the core operations of Btree and B+
trees, including insertion, deletion, and search, to create a functional data struc-
ture. This involved defining the structure of nodes, splitting and merging nodes
to maintain balance, and ensuring proper ordering of data within the tree. De-
tailed explanations of how B+ trees optimize search and retrieval operations were
provided. B+ trees offer logarithmic time complexity for searching, making them
efficient for database applications.The project conducted a thorough performance
analysis of B+ trees. It included evaluating the time complexity of search opera-
tion and comparing the results with Btree. This analysis showcased the advantages
and limitations of using B+ trees in real-world scenarios
